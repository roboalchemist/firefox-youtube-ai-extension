# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon-96.png` - 96x96 pixels

For now, these are referenced in manifest.json but not required for basic functionality.

You can create these icons with any image editor or use online tools to generate Firefox extension icons.

Suggested icon theme: A checkmark or eye symbol to represent "already watched" functionality.
