I want to create a firefox extension to make youtube.com more like I would like.

Instead of going through the sub-menu on each video on the home page to select "Not Interested" and then have to select "Tell us why" to select I've already watched this video", I want a button in the lower-right hand area of the video box that lets me select "already watched" with just an icon. It should have tool-tip to idicate what it means.
